#  NLP What it is and what are its applications

NLP is the ability of machines to understand and analyze human language. It is a part of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain with a significant overlap with Linguistics.

However, natural languages are extremely complex systems. 
Any human language is a complex interplay of different sub-systems such as phonology, morphology, and semantics working seamlessly with each other.

Learning a language is far from straightforward, even for a human. If you are a native English speaker it will probably take you 2,000+ class hours to be fluent in Mandarin. That’s several years’ worth of studying! 

This is the reason why the progress in NLP has been slow as compared with other areas within Machine Learning and AI.

# NLP Applications

NLP is a broad field, encompassing a variety of tasks, including:

- Part-of-speech tagging: identify if each word is a noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
- Named entity recognition NER): identify person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, etc)
- Question answering
- Speech recognition
- Text-to-speech and Speech-to-text
- Topic modeling
- Sentiment classification
- Language modeling
- Translation

The major tasks are 

1/ Lexical Processing

  * Stemming
  * Lemmatization
  * TF-IDF representation
  * Edit Distance (Let's build a spelling corrector)

2/ Syntactic Processing

  * POS (Part of Speech) Tagging
  * NER (Named Entity Recognition)
  * Let's build a POS tagger

3/ Semantic Processing

  * LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)
  * Word2Vec Models
  * Let's build a Sentiment Analysis App

4/ Other important applications

  * Text Classification App
  * Topic Modeling App
  * Text Summarization App


## Algorithms
